    <h2>Pilot can't quite escape the shadow of <i>Game of Thrones</i>, but it's eminently watchable.</h2>

    <p>Making a prequel to a beloved series is never easy, especially when it's a prequel to one of the most influential
        blockbuster series of the last decade—one that <a

            its finale</a> so badly that it alienated some of its most devoted fans.

            <i>House of Dragon</i></a> rose to the challenge, debuting last night with a solid, promising pilot episode.
        Granted, it suffers a bit in comparison with <i>Game of Thrones</i> (especially the earlier seasons). But this
        was an eminently watchable and entertaining pilot that might even win back some of those alienated fans if the
        rest of the season lives up to that promise.

    <p name="name">As I've <a   href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/07/dragons-are-front-and-center-in-latest-house-of-the-dragon-trailer/">written
            previously</a>,<i>House of the Dragon</i> is set about 200 years before the events of <i>Game of Thrones</i>
        and chronicles the beginning of the end of House Targaryen's reign. Those events culminated in a civil war and
        the extinction of the dragons—at least until Daenerys Targaryen came along. The primary source material is <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_%26_Blood_(novel)"><i>Fire and Blood</i></a>, a fictional history
        of the Targaryen kings written by George R.R. Martin. The book begins with Aegon I's conquest of the Seven
        Kingdoms of Westeros, thanks to the family's advanced weaponry: dragons. This is followed by a period of
        relative peace before the inevitable succession crisis. The final two sections of Fire and Blood deal with the
        fallout of that crisis and serve as the primary source material for <i>House of the Dragon.</i></p>
